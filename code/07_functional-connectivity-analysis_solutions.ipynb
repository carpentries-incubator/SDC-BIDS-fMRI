    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have an idea of three important components to analyzing neuroimaging data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data manipulation\n",
    "2. Cleaning and confound regression\n",
    "3. Parcellation and signal extraction\n",

    "In this notebook the goal is to integrate these 3 basic components and perform a full analysis of group data using **Intranetwork Functional Connectivity (FC)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Intranetwork functional connectivity is essentially a result of performing correlational analysis on mean signals extracted from two ROIs. Using this method we can examine how well certain resting state networks, such as the **Default Mode Network (DMN)**, are synchronized across spatially distinct regions. \n",
