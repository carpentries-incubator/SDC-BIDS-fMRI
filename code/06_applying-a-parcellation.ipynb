    "# Introduction\n",
    "## What is a Brain Atlas or Parcellation?\n",
    "A brain atlas/parcellation is a voxel-based labelling of your data into \"structural or functional units\". In a parcellation schema each voxel is assigned a numeric (integer) label corresponding to the structural/functional unit that the particular voxel is thought to belong to based on some criteria. You might wonder why someone would simply *average together a bunch of voxels* in a way that would reduce the richness of the data. This boils down to a few problems inherit to functional brain imaging:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Resting state data is noisy, averaging groups of \"similar\" voxels reduces the effect of random noise effects\n",
    "2. Provide an interpretative framework to functional imaging data. For example one parcellation group might be defined as the Default Mode Network which is thought to be functionally significant. So averaging voxels together belonging to the Default Mode Network provides an average estimate of the Default Mode Network signal. In addition the discovery of the Default Mode Network has yielded important insights into the organizational principles of the brain.\n",
    "3. Limit the number of statistical tests thereby reducing potential Type I errors without resorting to strong statistical correction techniques that might reduce statistical power.\n",
    "4. A simpler way to visualize your data, instead of 40x40x40=6400 data points, you might have 17 or up to 200; this is still significantly less data to deal with!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applying a Parcellation to your Data\n",
    "Since the parcellation of a brain is defined (currently) by spatial locations, application of an parcellation to fMRI data only concerns the first 3 dimensions; the last dimension (time) is retained. Thus a parcellation assigns every voxel (x,y,z) to a particular parcel ID (an integer).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Nilearn supports a large selection of different atlases that can be found [here](http://nilearn.github.io/modules/reference.html#module-nilearn.datasets). For information about how to select which parcellation to use for analysis of your data we refer you to Arslan et al. 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieving the Atlas\n",
    "For this tutorial we'll be using a set of parcellation from [Yeo et al. 2011](link). This atlas was generated from fMRI data from 1000 healthy control participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we'll load in our packages as usual:\n"

    "## Spatial Separation of Network\n",
    "A key feature of the Yeo2011 networks is that they are *spatially distributed*, meaning that the locations of two voxels in the same network need not be part of the same region. However, there could be some cases in which you might want to examine voxels belonging to a network within a particular region. To do this, we can separate parcels belonging to the same network based on spatial continuity. If there is a gap between two sets of voxels belonging to the same parcel group, we can assign new labels to separate them out. Nilearn has a feature to handle this:\n"
