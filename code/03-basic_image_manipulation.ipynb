The simplest operations we can perform is element-wise, what this means is that we want to perform some sort of mathematical operation on each voxel of the MR image. Since voxels are represented in a 3D array, this is equivalent to performing an operation on each element (i,j,k) of a 3D array. Let’s try inverting the image, that is, flip the colour scale such that all blacks appear white and vice-versa. To do this, we’ll use the method\n",

    "### Applying a Mask\n",
    "Let’s extend this idea of applying operations to each element of an image to multiple images. Instead of specifying just one image like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>img.math_img('a+1',a=img_a)</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can specify multiple images by tacking on additional variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>img.math_img('a+b', a=img_a, b=img_b)</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "The key requirement here is that when dealing with multiple images, that the size of the images must be the same. The reason being is that we’re deaing with element-wise operations. That means that some voxel (i,j,k) in img_a is being paired with some voxel (i,j,k) in <code>img_b</code> when performing operations. So every voxel in <code>img_a</code> must have some pair with a voxel in <code>img_b</code>; sizes must be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can take advantage of this property when masking our data using multiplication. Masking works by multipling a raw image (our <code>t1</code>), with some mask image (our <code>bm</code>). Whichever voxel (i,j,k) has a value of 0 in the mask multiplies with voxel (i,j,k) in the raw image resulting in a product of 0. Conversely, any voxel (i,j,k) in the mask with a value of 1 multiplies with voxel (i,j,k) in the raw image resulting in the same value. Let’s try this out in practice and see what the result is:"
