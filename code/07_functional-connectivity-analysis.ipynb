    "Now we have an idea of three important components to analyzing neuroimaging data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data manipulation\n",

    "\n",

Using this method we can examine how well certain resting state networks, such as the **Default Mode Network (DMN)**, are synchronized across spatially distinct regions. \n",
