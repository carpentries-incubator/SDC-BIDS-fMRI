    "So far most of our work has been examining anatomical images - the reason being is that it provides a nice visual way of exploring the effects of data manipulation and visualization is easy. In practice, you will most likely not analyze anatomical data using <code>nilearn</code> since there are other tools that are better suited for that kind of analysis (freesurfer, connectome-workbench, mindboggle, etc...). \n",
