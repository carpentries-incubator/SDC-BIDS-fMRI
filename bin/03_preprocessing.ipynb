    "[fmriprep](https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a package developed by the Poldrack lab to do the minimal preprocessing of fMRI data required. It covers brain extraction, motion correction, field unwarping, and registration. It uses a combination of well-known software packages (e.g., FSL, SPM, ANTS, AFNI) and selects the 'best' implementation of each preprocessing step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed, `fmriprep` can be invoked from the command line. We can even run it inside this notebook! The following command should work after you remove the 'hashtag' `#`. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, running fmriprep takes quite some time (we included the hashtag to prevent you from accidentally running it). You'll most likely want to run it in parallel on a computing cluster."
