## Background

This is one sub-module within the [Neuroimaging cirriculum][neuro_cirriculum]. Visit the link to view all the modules associated with the Neuroimaging Carpentries program.

**fMRI Analysis in Python** is a programme developed to facilitate reproducibility in functional neuroimaging analyses. Python is emerging as a standard language of data analysis, visualization, and workflow building. More recently, it has rapidly been adopted by the neuroimaging community as a means of developing powerful open-source tools in favour of historically used opaque software such as AFNI, FSL and SPM. In addition, the barrier to entry to Python is low - meaning that you as the user can easily develop your own packages and contribute to the open-source codebase of neuroimaging!


***

The **fMRI Analysis in Python** is a workshop series started up via a collaboration between researchers and staff at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (Toronto, ON), the University of Western Ontario (London, Ontario), and McGill University (Montreal, Quebec).

## About the lesson

This lesson covers fMRI imaging analysis from the basic steps of preprocessing and data cleaning, to running an analysis, to exploring connectivity patterns in the brain.

### Episodes

| Time | Episode | Question(s) Answered |
| ---  | ---     | ---                  |
||Setup|Download files required for the lesson|
| 00:00 | 1. Introduction to Course | Raw fMRI data is unsuable, what steps should one take before using their fMRI data? |
| 00:25 | 2. Exploring Preprocessed fMRI Data from fMRIPREP | How does fMRIPrep store preprocessed neuroimaging data. How do I access preprocessed neuroimaging data  |
| 00:50 | 3. Introduction to Image Manipulation using Nilearn | How can we perform arithmetic operations on MR images |
| 01:25 | 4. Integrating Functional Data  | How is fMRI data represented. How can we access fMRI data along spatial and temporal dimensions. How can we integrate fMRI and structural MRI together |
| 02:00 | 6. Cleaning Confounders in your Data with Nilearn | How can we clean the data so that it more closely reflects BOLD instead of artifacts  |
| 02:45 | 7. Applying Parcellations to Resting State Data | How can we reduce amount of noise-related variance in our data? How can we frame our data as a set of meaningful features?  |
| 03:15 | 8. Functional Connectivity Analysis | How can we estimate brain functional connectivity patterns from resting state data? |
| 04:00 | Finish | |
